# 📘 Book Inventory Management System – Frontend

The **Book Inventory Management System Frontend** is a React-based web application developed as part of a full-stack academic project. It provides a clean, interactive, and user-friendly interface for managing book inventory operations efficiently.

This frontend acts as the visual layer of the system, enabling users to interact with the backend services through a responsive and intuitive UI.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Traditional book inventory management often involves manual processes that are time-consuming and error-prone. This frontend application digitizes the user experience by providing an interactive interface to perform all inventory operations seamlessly.

The application communicates with a Spring Boot backend using REST APIs to ensure smooth and real-time data exchange.

---

## 🧩 Application Architecture

The frontend follows a **component-based architecture** using React to promote modularity and reusability:

🔹 **Components** – Reusable UI elements for inventory operations  
🔹 **Pages / Views** – Screens for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting books  
🔹 **Service Layer** – Handles API communication with the backend  
🔹 **State Management** – Manages UI state and data flow  

📡 The frontend consumes REST APIs exposed by the backend.  
🔗 **GitHub** manages source control and version tracking.  
🌐 **Vercel** is used for deployment, enabling automated builds and production hosting.
